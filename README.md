## S3 Sample plugin
This plugin is for use with TARILIO (previously known as eSearch) to enable indexing and searching of files stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets.

TARILIO is an information retrieval product incorporating both full-text search using the Apache Lucene search engine and multi-turn conversation ability via online or locally installed Large Language Models (LLMs).

TARILIO is part of the open source [eSearch-project](https://github.com/electronart/esearch-project/wiki)

It can connect to private or public S3 buckets. This plugin includes a connection to a public sample S3 bucket for test purposes.

### Contributing
Feel free to fork and use as a basis for developing plugins to connect to other online data sources for the eSearch-project.
