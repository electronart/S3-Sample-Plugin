This plugin is for use with TARILIO (previously known as eSearch Pro) and TARILIO PRO to enable indexing and searching of files stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets.

TARILIO and TARILIO PRO are information retrieval products incorporating both full-text search using the Apache Lucene search engine and multi-turn conversation ability using online or locally installed Large Language Models (LLMs).

TARILIO is part of the open source [eSearch-project](https://github.com/electronart/esearch-project/wiki) TARILIO PRO is the version licensed for commercial usage.

This plugin can connect to private or public S3 buckets, it includes a connection to a public sample S3 bucket for test purposes.
