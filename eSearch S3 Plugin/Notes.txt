--------------------

Provides basic information about the Plugin to eSearch to display in the Plugin Manager UI.
Also declares the minimum required version to ensure compatibility.

S3DataSourceManager.cs
--------------------

Manages DataSources and their configurations.

In this case, the DataSource is Amazon S3 and the configuration is which S3 buckets should be indexed in which index.

Note that it implements IPluginDataSourceManager. eSearch looks for classes implementing this interface. There should be one for each datasource the plugin supports.

S3BucketDataSource.cs
---------------------
